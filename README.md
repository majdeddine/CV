## Majdeddine Jebri

I am a graduate Mechanical Engineer very passionate about coding. I have followed my passion and learned on my own how to code until I joined Makers Academy.

## Experience

**Prototyping Engineer-Data Science at Sensyne Health** (Feb'18 - present)

Sensyne Health, in partnership with academics of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) at Oxford University as well as clinicians from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH), are engaging in a project aimed at exploring a powerful clinical dataset for the purpose of finding insights, creating new tools that improve patient care, and creating commercial value for the NHS.

My work in this project is at the intersection of software engineering and data science. This includes:

- Exploratory data analysis, often involving visualising data in useful and informative ways to aid hypothesis generation by the Clinician and Data Scientists at Sensyne
- Manipulating data into forms better suited to use in Machine Learning/statistical techniques
- Contributing to the development of the anonymisation algorithm to be run on the clinical dataset to protect patient privacy
- Statistical modeling, such as hierarchical Gaussian process

I work predominantly in Python and SQL.

## Skills

#### Self Taught

I'm always interested in learning new things and very curious and passionate about the latest technology. I have started coding on my own doing CodeWars, Kata, got very hooked and achieved 4Kyu before starting Makers.


#### Fast Learner

In 2 weeks time I was able to learn Node, Express and React without them being taught on the course and used them to build my final project.


#### Delivers under Pressure

During my University years I have always juggled multiple projects and challenges for which I had to develop time management skills and work ethic. I enjoy being outside of my comfort zone and I'm always taking on new challenges.
